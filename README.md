String Generator

This is a program to help in generating Random String Sequences that can be used as Passwords or for any other reason you may need a random String Sequence.

To run just use your command line or terminal and use the file StringGenerator.class by typing "java StringGenerator -u -l -n -s 8" when in the same directory as the file.

Was just a fun little side project.

The String Generator takes the options:
-l or --lowercase to include lowercase letters
-u or --uppercase to include uppercase letters
-n or --numbers to include numbers
-s or --symbols to include symbols
and at the end the length you want the String Result to be.
